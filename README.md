## Description
Refactored the code for the Horiseon homepage with two goals:
1. Improve accessibility of webpage so that it is optimized for search enginges
2. Improve codebase for long-term sustainability

## Accessbility
Accessibility is an important aspect to consider when designing a webpage. For one, following the accessibilty standards allows for people using screen readers to better understand the content on the page. Additionally, an accessible webpage has better search engine optimization.
I improved the accessibility of this webpage by:
* Replacing non-semantic HTML elements with semantic HTML elements
* Adding descriptive alt text to any images on the webpage
* Adding a title to the webpage

## Refactoring existing code
For long-term sustainability of a webpage, it is important that the code is organized and easy to follow.
I improved the the codebase of this webpage by:
* Making sure all links worked properly
* Ensuring that the flow of the elements was logical
* Cleaning up the CSS by re-organizing consolidating certain rules
